      Despite being one of the oldest cities in the US, the city of Philadelphia
      has the particularity of having a great number of vacant land available,
      even close to its center core. This phenomenon can be in part attributed
      to the discriminatory practices of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, also
      known as ‘redlining’, over the middle of the 20th century, which prevented
      the majority black residents of South, North and West Philly to access
      loans.
      <br></br>
      While much of these areas remained vacant over the last 80 years, this
      trend is changing as the city’s population continues to grow.
