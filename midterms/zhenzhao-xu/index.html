                <p>
                    Hi, come to know `Great Knot` (Calidris tenuirostris)! It is a small wader, but also a great
                    long-distance migratory shorebird of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a great knot~ Her tag may say "XNC", but she is <b>Beak Beak</b> to the reseacher. As a
                    "research
                    assistant" of Deakin University, Australia, Beak Beak will carry a small solar-satellite device
                    throughout this summer. Let's see how is she doing.

                    This is Beak Beak's home in Broome, Australia. A beautiful beach with lots of molluscs and insects.

                    Sometimes, Beak Beak can easily fly over the Indian Ocean and even the South China Sea with the
                    help of the power of subtropical monsoon. With some good luck, the wind speed can reach up to
                    <b>50 kilometers per hour</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It'll take Beak-Beak around 10-15 days to get to the east China, and get some rest there.

                    Unknowingly, it's mid April. It's time to get some energy to move on. Yellow Sea is its chance to
                    have a good meal on the journey. The beaches, swamps and marshes with lots of molluscs and insects
                    are like a cafeteria for her.

                    With its beak full of receptors, it goes deep into the soil of 3-5cm and looks for its lunch. During
                    the following month, she will constantly travel to and from the Yellow Sea of China and change
                    different restaurants every day.

                <p>

                    It is worth noting that due to the excessive development of coastal maps in recent years, such good
                    restaurants (wetlands) have become less and less. (to be supplemented)

                    Many sandpipers form monogamous pairs, so does Beak Beak. She meets her husband in northeast
                    Siberia. They finds a tundra that is perfect for babies.

                    They exchange on the nest in the morning and in the evening so that their incubation rhythm follows
                    a 24-hour day. Their children hatch after about three weeks of incubation and are able to walk and
                    forage within a few hours of hatching. Beak Beak and her husband guide and brood their children
                    together.
