    <p>I always thought that my great-grandmother Jeanette was from Poland - but this is both correct and incorrect. This story map visualizes her home village of <strong>Horodetz</strong> amidst the changing boundaries of Poland from 1715 through 1994.</p>

    <p>The named country of Poland disappeared from the international map, but it was not without resistence. Many Horodetz Jews sided with Poland during the Polish "povstanya" (rebellions).</p>
    <p>Economically and culturally Jews in the Horodetz shtetl during this time were living mostly as store-keepers, craftsmen, and clergy. The area became an important center for commercial activity due its proximity to a canal.</p>
    <p>However, the Russian regime also took note of its strategic location. The regime made Horodetz a military stronghold, stationing soldiers in the area starting in 1876.`,

    <p>At this time, the war brought about a violent upheaval, destroying the old way of living. Since the shtetl was located strategically next to two tall riverbanks, it became battlefield between the Russians and the Germans. The shtetl was almost totally demolished: Jewish houses were burnt down, especially those in the center of town.`,
