      In CPLN 504 - Site Planning class this semeter, we are redesigning the
      block in Grays Ferry, Philadelphia, PA. The site is about 142,000 sq ft,
      and it current has an abandoned grocery building. We are asked to add 40-50
      affordable housing units and 2000-4000 sq ft of commercials retail space.
      This story map walks through some analysis of the site and design ideas.

      Here comes our designing ideas. First, we want to extend the Oakford St
      which currently stops east to our site. By extending that street, the site
      will be divided into two parts. The upper triangle can be used as a buffer
      zone to prevent noise on the Grays Ferry Ave. Click on the feature to see
      the planning vision or a typology.

      We are planning a community center in this site because there current isn't

      green roof because the people will be able to see Philadelphia's skyline from
      this area. A planned community center at Upper Darby can be used a typology.

      people enjoy the open space with restaurants and shops.

      There will be two green spaces. The upper one with larger trees will stand
      between the road and residential area. It can also be used for out door
      dinning. The lower one is more like a community garden shared by the residents
      of the row houses. A typology for that can be the share pedestrian area between
      row houses in Grad Hospital region.

      will look like the existing parking across the street. However, the residential
      parking will look more similar to other public housing projects in Grays
      Ferry where residents park the cars at their back yards.
