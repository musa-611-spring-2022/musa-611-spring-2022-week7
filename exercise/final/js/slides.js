    Ibrahimovic was born in the southern Swedish city of Malmo. His parents met in Malmo and divorced when he was two years old. 
    After that he lived with his father, but according to him: "I live with my father, but spend most of the time with my mother." 
    In 1995, he left the Malmo Balkan youth team to play for Malmo Football Club. 
    In 1999, Ibrahimovic was promoted to the regular team and appeared in the Swedish Super League and he performed well in the first season. 
    His performance attracted the Premier League team Arsenal's coach Arsene Wenger who invited him to join and brought a number 9 jersey with his name to Sweden. 
    When Zlatan Ibrahimovic has arrived in London and has already visited Arsenal's stadium, Wenger still wants him to go through a series of trials. 
    Ibrahimovic felt that the requirement that his strength needed a trial to prove was an insult to himself, so he left London for the Eredivisie giants Ajax.

    In the summer of 2009, Ibrahimovic joined the La Liga giants Barcelona, and was put on the No. 9 jersey of the departing player Eto'o. 
    The essence of the transfer is that Barcelona gets Ibrahimovic for 46 million euros plus the ownership of Eto'o. 
    The total value of the transaction is about 70 million euros, which is the most expensive acquisition in Barcelona's history, 
    which was not broken until 2014 by Suarez. After losing the Champions League to last season's club Inter Milan, 
    he had an irreconcilable conflict with head coach Guardiola. In his autobiography I Am Zlatan, he states, 
    "'It started well but then Messi started to talk. He wanted to play in the middle, not on the wing, so the system changed from 4-3-3 to 4-5-1. 
    I was sacrificed and no longer had the freedom on the pitch I need to succeed."
