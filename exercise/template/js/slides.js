      The Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775) were the first
      military engagements of the American Revolutionary War. They were fought
      on April 19, 1775, in Middlesex County, Province of Massachusetts Bay,
      within the towns of Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Menotomy
      (present-day Arlington), and Cambridge, near Boston. The result was an
      American victory.

      Boston in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. Even though
      they won the battle and were able to push the Patriots away from the crucial
      Charleston peninsula, the British experienced far more casualties.

      31, 1775, between American Continental Army forces and the British
      defenders of Quebec City early in the American Revolutionary War. The
      battle was the first major defeat of the war for the Americans, and it
      came with heavy losses. General Richard Montgomery was killed, Benedict
      Arnold was wounded, and Daniel Morgan and more than 400 men were taken
      prisoner.

      The Siege of Boston (April 19, 1775 – March 17, 1776) concluded the opening
      phase of the American Revolutionary War. New England militiamen prevented
      the movement by land of the British Army garrisoned in what was then the
      peninsular town of Boston, Massachusetts. Both sides had to deal with
      resource supply and personnel issues over the course of the siege.
      British resupply and reinforcement activities were limited to sea access.
      On March 17th 1776 (11 months after the seige began), George Washington
      and the Continental Army seized Dorchester Heights, just outside of
      Boston, and pointed their cannons at the British ships anchored in the
      harbor, leading to a British retreat.

      The Battle of Fort Sullivan (June 28, 1776), often disregarded as a minor
      action during the American Revolutionary War, was a British attempt to
      expand the war southwards. Just near Charleston, Fort Sullivan provided a
      major seaport. When the British failed to capture it, it forced the war's
      focus on the north for the next couple of years.

      The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the

      battle of the war. The Patriots were outflanked and routed on Long
      Island, but were able to escape to Manhattan. A major defeat for
      the Continental Army under General George Washington and the beginning of
      a successful campaign that gave the British control of the strategically
      important city of New York.

      during the American Revolutionary War between the United States and Great
      Britain. It was a decisive British victory that gained the surrender of
      the remnent of the garrison of Fort Washington near the north end of
      Manhattan Island. Perhaps the worst Patriot defeat during the war, this
      battle led to the British capture of over 3000 colonists in Manhattan.

      The Battle of Trenton was a small but pivotal battle during the American
      Revolutionary War which took place on the morning of December 26, 1776,
      in Trenton, New Jersey. After General George Washington's crossing of the
      Delaware River north of Trenton the previous night, Washington led the
      main body of the Continental Army against Hessian soldiers garrisoned at
      Trenton. After a brief battle, nearly the entire Hessian force was
      captured, with negligible losses to the Americans.

      The Battle of Freeman Farm (September 19, 1777) was the First Battle of
      Saratoga and marked one of the longest land battles in the Revolutionary
      War. British General John Burgoyne led the large invasion army up the
      Champlain Valley from Canada, hoping to meet a similar force marching
      northward from New York City. However, the southern force never arrived,
      and Burgoyne was surrounded by American forces in upstate New York.
      Although the result was a tactical British victory, as they held the field of
      battle at the end of the day, it set the British up for failure in the
      second battle.

      giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the
      American Revolutionary War. Fought after the Battle of Freeman Farm
      and on the same stretch of land, the battle resulted in the surrender of

      not only stopped American military momentum gained from Saratoga and the
      recovery of Philadelphia, but showed that the alliance with France would
      not bring a speedy end to the war. The northern theater remained in a
      stalemate for the rest of the war.

      The Siege of Charleston (March 29 - May 12, 1780) was another attempt by
      the British to shift the focus of the war onto the South. After suffering
      significant loses in their northern strategy in 1777 and after losing
      control of Philadelphia in 1778, the British moved South hoping to claim
      victory there. Commanding the Charleston garrison was Major General
      Benjamin Lincoln who surrendered his forces to the British after the six
      week siege. This is largely considered as one of the greatest American
      defeats in the war.

      British having to rethink their strategy in the South and demonstrated

      led by Colonel Banastre Tarleton. It was a turning point in the reconquest

      General George Washington and French Army troops led by the Comte de
      Rochambeau over a British Army commanded by British lord and Lieutenant
      General Charles Cornwallis. The culmination of the Yorktown campaign, the
      siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American
      Revolutionary War in the North American theater, as the surrender by
      Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British
      government to negotiate an end to the conflict.
